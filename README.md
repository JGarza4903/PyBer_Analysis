# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Analyze data from Pyber ride sharing company to visualize data points gathered over a course of several months.
1. Gather information relating to the average, median and mode for the following:
* Total number of rides for each city type.
* Average fares for each city type.
* Total number of drivers for each city type.

2. Create Box and Whisker plots to visualize gathered data and determine if there are any outliers for the following:.
* Number of fares for each city type
* Fares for each city type
* Number of drivers per city type

3. Create pie charts that visualize data against city types for the following:.
* Percentage of total fares.
* Percentage of total rides.
* Percentage of total drivers.

## Summary
Analysis of Pyber Ride-Share data shows:

* Total amount of rides: 2,735

----------------------------------------
* **Total amount of drivers per city type:**

  * Urban: 2,405
  
  * Suburban: 490
  
  * Rural: 78
---------------------------------------

* **Average fare per ride for each city type:**

## Conclusion

![Pyber Summary - Total Fare by City Type](https://github.com/JGarza4903/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/Pyber-fare_summary.png)

Based on the data gathered, we can tell the average fare price is higher in Rural areas because the demand is not as high. In bigger cities, there are more chances of getting a driver to take someone from point A to point B which means the average price will go down.

If you wish for business to operate at successfully, stick to the bigger city types for revenue.

## Challenge Overview

The goal of this project was to learn how to drill down into data and gather data related to specific lists or dictionaries and use that data to create a visualization in the form of a bar grph, line graph, scatter plot and pie graphs.

### Topics experienced
* Filtering dataframes to view specific data
* Plotting dataframes from filtered data
* use of imports to import libraries from Python

### Outcomes
* Better understanding of how pandas integrates with other libraries such as matplotlib.
* Need to focus on proper use and syntax for groupby functions.
* Knowledge of which visualization to use for certain data sets.

## Resources
**Python** 3.10.7
* Pandas library
* Matplotlib library
